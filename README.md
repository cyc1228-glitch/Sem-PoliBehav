# Sem-PoliBehav
This repository is for "Seminar on Political Behavior", which is a seminar I organize for other undergraduate students at National Taiwan University (NTU) (under NTU PSSA) during 2025-26 academic year. You can find the reading list, slides, and reading materials for this seminar here.

Here are some awesome resources about quantitative reasoning/research design/causal inference/experiments in political science:

Imai, Kosuke, and Nora Webb Williams. 2022. *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction in tidyverse.* Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.

In my view, this course is more practical and helpful than the social statistics course we have @NTU. This website contains lecture slides, lecture videos, tutorials and problem sets in R. This is basically a great course for learning, both in basic understandings of the role of quantitative methods in political science and skills in R.
